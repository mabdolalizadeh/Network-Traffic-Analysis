# Developing a Network Traffic Capture and Analysis Tool with Python

## Understanding the Task
To capture and analyze network traffic at the data-link layer, we primarily need to focus on the physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model. This involves capturing raw Ethernet frames, which contain information like the source and destination MAC addresses, frame type, and payload data.

## Python Libraries for Network Traffic Capture and Analysis
Python offers several powerful libraries to accomplish this task:
1. Scapy: A powerful packet manipulation tool that allows you to craft, send, sniff, dissect, and analyze packets.
2. Pyshark: A Python wrapper for TShark, providing a more Pythonic interface for packet analysis.
3. Impacket: A collection of Python classes for working with network protocols.

## Basic Network Traffic Capture with Scapy
```python
from scapy.all import *

def sniff_packets(filter="tcp"):
    packets = sniff(filter=filter, count=10)
    wrpcap("captured_packets.pcap", packets)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sniff_packets()
```
### Explanation:
- `sniff`: Captures packets based on the specified filter.
- `filter`: Filters packets based on various criteria, like protocol type, IP address, or port number.
- `count`: Specifies the number of packets to capture.
- `wrpcap`: Writes the captured packets to a PCAP file.

## Deeper Analysis with Pyshark
```python
import pyshark

def analyze_packets(pcap_file="captured_packets.pcap"):
    cap = pyshark.FileCapture(pcap_file)
    for packet in cap:
        print(packet)  # Print basic packet information
        print(packet.eth.src)  # Access source MAC address
        print(packet.eth.dst)  # Access destination MAC address
        # ... other fields like packet length, timestamp, etc.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_packets()
```
### Explanation:
- `FileCapture`: Opens a PCAP file for analysis.
- `packet.eth.src` and `packet.eth.dst`: Access specific fields within the Ethernet layer.
- Pyshark provides a rich interface to explore various layers and fields of the packet.

## Advanced Analysis and Visualization
For more advanced analysis and visualization, you can combine these libraries with other tools like:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib** or **plotly**: For data visualization.
- **NetworkX**: For network graph visualization.

### Example: Visualizing Network Traffic
```python
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... (extract source and destination MAC addresses from packets)

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
for src, dst in edges:
    G.add_edge(src, dst)

# Visualize the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_size=500, node_color='skyblue', font_size=10, font_color='black', edge_color='gray', width=2)
plt.show()
```
### Additional Considerations:
- **Performance**: For high-speed networks, consider using tools like `tshark` directly from Python using subprocess or specialized libraries like `dpkt`.
- **Security**: Be mindful of network security policies and ethical considerations when capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Use libraries like `scapy` to capture packets in real-time and perform analysis on the fly.
- **Custom Protocols**: If you're dealing with custom protocols, you'll need to write custom dissectors using Scapy or Pyshark.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, you can effectively capture and analyze network traffic at the data-link layer, gaining valuable insights into network behavior and potential security threats.
